# Survive-Zombie-World

This is a turn-based strategy/puzzle game.
Players have to explore the map to find items in order to complete the story and make the Boss Zombie appear.

Players only have 20 turns. The game can only be won when the Boss Zombie is dead.

Each player have a movement radius, which is also their attack radius. The players MUST find weapons first to defend themselves and the movement radius can change with certian items or when you kill zombies.

Once each player's turn is done, press enter to switch turn.

That's all the help you need. Happy Exploring!
